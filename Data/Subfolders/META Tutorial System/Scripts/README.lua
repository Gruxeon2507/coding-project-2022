---Tutorial with Images---

Basic Image Setup

    For any game in Core, you can use the uploaded images on that game. If you have the game url like https://www.coregames.com/games/f8b143/spellshock-2,
    use f8b143/spellshock-2 for the Game ID. Drag the Screenshot Index to set the image you want. Game screenshots are limited to 5 per game, but basically
    you can reference ANY GAME, so you have a near infinite selection of images. A game just needs to be published for the images to be available, 
    even Unlisted, as long as you know the Game ID.


Basic Tutorial Setup

    Tab Panel Setup
        1. To make a new tab, duplicate one of the existing ones.
        2. Edit the Custom Property [TabIndex] to the next logical number. This will set the order on how the Tab Buttons will appear.
        3. To change the content of the Tab, go to the UI Content Panel and edit:
            - Title
            - Screenshot
            - Description
            - Tip
