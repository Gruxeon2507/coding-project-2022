This community content bundle contains the Boss NPC/models that were used in my game 
Sorcerer's Watch for the DnD contest.

The npc's are setup the same as other NPC's that came with the Dungeon Crawler Framework 
(previously called "Dungeons and dragons")

To setup:

Once you've dragged and dropped the template into the Hierachy or Main Viewport, deinstance the group
containing the boss npc's, the group called "Sorcerers_Watch_NPC_Pack".

Next select a "NPC" group and "Create New Template From This", then do that for the remaining 3 "NPC"

You can now use these by either spawning in, or placing in the game.
 

Any issues, feel free to @ me on the Core Discord, username: JasonCdesign

Enjoy!
